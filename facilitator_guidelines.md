### Facilitator Guidelines:

* **Participant Choice** - Allow the participant to choose an algorithm that is challenging yet something they feel can be completed in the allotted time. 

* **Ask Questions** - It's important to begin this process with asking the participant if they have any questions regarding the problem. At a bare minimum make sure they **reinstate the question** and **confirm the requirements**.  Encourage them to ask at least 1 or 2 additional relevant questions before they begin as this conveys they have the foresight to address potential issues.

* **Encourage Talking** - The participant should be talking out loud consistently throughout this process.  Allow no more than 1 minute of silence to pass before you ask that they continue to talk through the problem so you can better understand their thought process. 

* **Provide Guidance** - Provide only the necessary guidance to help the participant think through the problem.  As tempting as it may seem to write actual code snippets or discuss the benefits of array looping constructs take a step back and provide only what is needed for them make that realization themselves. 

* **Answering Questions** - Keep your answers as concise as possible with just enough to keep them moving forward in the right direction.  You are permitted to make suggestions about the benefits and pitfalls for any given approach but allow the participant to make that choice on their own.

* **Course Correction** - There might come a point when the participants approach is way off track or that their logic needs a course correction.  If this happens help them see the limitations of their approach and make the necessary suggestions to get them back on track.

* **Time Check** - Provide them with a time check at the 5 and 2 min mark.  Although the best case scenario is that they write both the steps and code to solve the problem it's more important that their logic is concise and solves the problem prior to writing any code.  The time check queues are meant to make them aware of their time constraints as well as add an additional level of stress.
