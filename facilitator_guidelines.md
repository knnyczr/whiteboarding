### Facilitator Guidelines:

* **Participant Choice** - Allow the participant to choose an algorithm that is challenging yet something they feel can be completed in the allotted time. 

* **Ask Questions** - It's important to begin this process with asking the participant if they have any questions regarding the problem. At a bare minimum make sure they **reinstate the question** and **confirm the requirements**.  Encourage them that it's important to ask at least 1 or 2 additional relevant questions before they begin as this conveys they have the foresight to address potential issues.

* **Encourage Talking** - The participant should be talking out loud consistently throughout the challenge as though they are trying to explain the process to someone else.  Allow no more than 1 minute of silence to pass before you provide ask that they talk through the problem so you can better understand their thought process. 

* **Provide Guidance** - Provide only the necessary guidance to help the participant think through the problem.  As tempting as it may seem to write actual code snippets or discuss the benefits of array looping constructs take a step back and provide only what is needed for them make that realization themselves. 

* **Answering Questions** - Keep your answers as concise as possible with just enough to keep them moving forward in the right direction.  You may even make suggestions about the benefits and pitfalls for any given approach
