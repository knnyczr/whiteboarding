#Whiteboarding

Here is a list of algorithmic problems (and solutions) that will help prepare you for your next whiteboarding interview session.  They start easy and increase with difficulty so choose one that is challenging and will push your comfort level.  

The most important goal of whiteboarding is the need to verbally walk the facilitator throught their thought process.  This first begins with writting out the steps needed to code the solution and then writing the code needed to accomplish the taks, all the while vocalizing the process. 

### Things to keep in mind:

* **Ask Questions** -  At a bare minimum make sure to **reinstate the question** and **confirm the requirements**.  If something is not clear or you feel additional information is needed before you can continue, be sure to ask your interviewer for clarification with as many follow-up questions needed to eliminate any ambiguity.

* What type of values will the array contain: primitives, hashes, arrays? 
* If it does contain nested arrays, should I loop through and print those values as well? 
* Is it possible that the array might be empty and should I account for this? 
* Should the function console.log() the items as they are encountered or should it return a string with newline characters?

* **Explain your thought process** - After the details of the task are clear, be sure to **talk out loud** as you begin to solve the problem. The interviewer wants to know what is going on in your head and to understand your approach, so being able to **explain your thoughts** is crucial. For this portion of your interview, often times, you will be judged on your thought process, regardless of whether you’re able to provide a solid answer.

* **Write Down The Steps** - This is a natural progression to explaining your thought process.  You are attempting to **write an algorithm** which is a **series of steps** needed to solve a specific problem.  Since there are always alternative solutions, your steps define your algorithmic approach to this problem.  Clearly verbalizing and writing down the steps will weigh heavily even if you run out of time while coding the solution. They want to see that you have clearly thought about the problem and the steps needed to solve it more so than coding the actual solution. 

* **Keeping Your Code Intuitive** - Imagine that another developer will be using the steps you have written to code out the solution.  How can you convery with as much clarity everything that needs to be accounted for in the appropriate steps.  That being said the more meticulous you are the easier it will be to code.  Make sure all variabes\functions are semantically named according to the contents\purpose.  If needed, leave comments about any items that may need addressing   

* **Be Confident** - Sometimes, during your whiteboard interview, it may be difficult to think of an answer when you’re on the spot, but **keeping your cool** and staying confident in your abilities will always leave a good impression. You’ve put in the time and effort to prepare yourself for your whiteboard interview, so trust your instincts and go with your gut.
