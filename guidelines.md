### Facilitator Guidelines:

* **Participant Choice** - Allow the particpant to choose an algorithm that is challenging yet something they feel can be completed in the alloted time. 

* **Ask Questions** - It's important to begin this process with asking the participant if they have any questions regarding the problem. At a bare minimum make sure they **reinstate the question** and **confirm the requirements**.  Encourage them that it's important to ask at least 1 or 2 additional relevant questions before they begin as this conveys they have the forsight to address potential issues.

* **Encourage Talking** - The participant should be talking out loud consistently throughout the challenge as though they are trying to explain the process to someone else.  Allow no more than 1 minute of silence to pass before you provide ask that they talk through the problem so you can better understand their thought process. 

* **Provide Guidance** - Provide only the necessary guidance to help the participant think through the problem.  As tempting as it may seem to write actual code snippets or discuss the benefits of array looping constructs take a step back and provide only what is needed for them make that realization themselves. 

* **Answering Questions** - Keep your answers as concise as possible with just enough to keep them moving forward in the right direction.  You may even make suggestions about the benefits and pitfalls for any given approach 
 

### Participant Guidelines:

* **Participant Choice** - Choose an algorithm that is challenging yet something you feel can be completed in the alloted time. 

* **Ask Questions** -  At a bare minimum make sure to **reinstate the question** and **confirm the requirements**.  If something is not clear or you feel additional information is needed before you can continue, be sure to ask your interviewer for clarification with at least 1 or 2 questions needed to eliminate any ambiguity. 

* **Explain your thought process** - After the details of the task are clear, be sure to **talk out loud** as you begin to solve the problem. The interviewer wants to know what is going on in your head and to understand your approach, so being able to **explain your thoughts** is crucial. For this portion of your interview, often times, you will be judged on your thought process, regardless of whether you’re able to provide a solid answer.

* **Write Down The Steps** - This is a natural progression to explaining your thought process.  You are attempting to **write an algorithm** which is a **series of steps** needed to solve a specific problem.  Since there are always alternative solutions, your steps define your algorithmic approach to this problem.  Clearly verbalizing and writing down the steps will weigh heavily even if you run out of time while coding the solution. They want to see that you have clearly thought about the problem and the steps needed to solve it more so than coding the actual solution. 

* **Keeping Your Code Intuitive** - Imagine that another developer will be using the steps you have written to code out the solution.  How can you convery with as much clarity everything that needs to be accounted for in the appropriate steps.  That being said the more meticulous you are the easier it will be to code.  Make sure all variabes\functions are semantically named according to the contents\purpose.  If needed, leave comments about any items that may need addressing   

* **Be Confident** - Sometimes, during your whiteboard interview, it may be difficult to think of an answer when you’re on the spot, but **keeping your cool** and staying confident in your abilities will always leave a good impression. You’ve put in the time and effort to prepare yourself for your whiteboard interview, so trust your instincts and go with your gut.
