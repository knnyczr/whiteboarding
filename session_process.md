### Session Process

1) Count the number of facilitators. Assign each one a number.

2) Assign each of the students a number from one to the number of facilitators.

3) Send each group to a place where they have room for each of the students to stand up and whiteboard at the same time.

4) As a warm-up, have the group choose an easy problem that each member of the group will solve individually at the same time. Use this time to help students understand the flow: questions, pseudo-code, code writing. Allow 15 minutes for this in total, saving the last few minutes for instructor review and questions. 

5) Students at this point can elect to do one more problem together or move to solving problems individually, which more accurately simulates the whiteboarding interview.

##### Only One facilitator
If there is only one facilitator available, let the students all work on the problems at their own pace (no timing) and ask you for help as they need it. In the last half hour or fifteen minutes, ask if anyone wants to do a whiteboarding interview simulation and anyone else who's interested can watch.
