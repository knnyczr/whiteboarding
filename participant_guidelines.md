### Participant Guidelines:

The most important thing to take away from tonight is that communication is key -- ask good questions at the beginning and throughout the interview, talk out loud as you're solving the problem on the board, and write clear pseudo-code, both so that the interviewer can understand your problem-solving process and so that you know what your next steps are if you get lost while writing code.

* **Participant Choice** - Choose an algorithm that is challenging yet something you feel can be completed in the allotted time. 

* **Ask Questions** -  At a bare minimum make sure to **restate the question** and **confirm the requirements**. What language(s) am I allowed to use to solve the problem?  For a problem that deals with strings, how should I treat upper- and lower-case characters, spaces, and special characters?  If something is not clear or you feel additional information is needed before you can continue, be sure to ask your interviewer for clarification with at least 1 or 2 questions needed to eliminate any ambiguity. 

* **Explain your thought process** - After the details of the task are clear, be sure to **talk out loud** as you begin to solve the problem. The interviewer wants to know what is going on in your head and to understand your approach, so being able to **explain your thoughts** is crucial. For this portion of your interview, often times, you will be judged on your thought process, regardless of whether you’re able to provide a solid answer.

* **Write Down The Steps** - This is a natural progression to explaining your thought process.  You are attempting to **write an algorithm** which is a **series of steps** needed to solve a specific problem.  Since there are always alternative solutions, your steps define your algorithmic approach to this problem.  You will get credit for clearly verbalizing and writing down the steps to your solution even if you run out of time while writing the code. Interviewers want to see that you have clearly thought about the problem and the steps needed to solve it more so than coding the actual solution. 

* **Keep Your Code Intuitive** - Imagine that another developer will be using the steps you have written to code out the solution.  How can you convey, with as much clarity, everything that needs to be accounted for in the appropriate steps.  That being said the more meticulous you are the easier it will be to code.  Make sure all variables\functions are semantically named according to the contents\purpose.  If needed, leave comments about any items that may need addressing   

* **Be Confident** - Sometimes, during your whiteboard interview, it may be difficult to think of an answer when you’re on the spot, but **keeping your cool** and staying confident in your abilities will always leave a good impression. You’ve put in the time and effort to prepare yourself for your whiteboard interview, so trust your instincts and go with your gut.
